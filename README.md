# python-examples
Examples for some key libraries in Python that I use all the time. A way for me to remember and hopefully get others started.

## Pattern Example
The first example I created is pattern-example-twitter.py. Pattern is a great library that is installed via pip and can query Google, Twitter, etc. out of the box.

This twitter example connects to twitter and searches either a random string or terms you set via the terminal with the -s 'search terms'.

Terminal Example:
    $ python pattern-example-twitter.py -s 'Hello World'

## Tor Connect Example
Tor (The Onion Router) has a particular socks port and connection setup that needs configured to connect in Python. This example shows you how.
