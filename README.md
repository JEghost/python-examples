# python-examples
Examples for some key libraries in Python that I use all the time. A way for me to remember and hopefully get others started.

## Pattern Examples
The first example I created is pattern-examples.py. Pattern is a great library that is installed via pip and can query Google, Twitter, etc. out of the box.
